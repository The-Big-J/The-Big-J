# The-Big-J
This is our final group project for CS-113.
It's a float calculator using SSE/SSE2 scalar fp instructions.

## Building
Install GNU Assembler, GNU binutils and make on a x86-64 Linux system.
To build, simply run `make` in the root directory.
You can run the program by issuing `./thebigj` from the root directory (thebigj is a symlink to the actual file in bin/)
